# 🏭 Automated Conveyor & Elevator System – Siemens S7-200 + Factory I/O

## 🧾 Project Overview

This project simulates an advanced **factory automation system** integrating a **Belt Conveyor** and an **Elevator** mechanism to move and sort items across three levels. The goal is to ensure efficient, real-time item transfer from point A to point B using smart logic and counters.

Developed using **Siemens S7-200 PLC (CPU 224)** and visualized through **Factory I/O**, this system mimics realistic industrial operations and smart vertical transport.
